# Project Description

Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) presents a challenging task in computer vision, especially when applied to biodiversity datasets involving large inter-class similarity and intra-class variance. In this project, we explore and evaluate the effectiveness of three convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures: DenseNet121, Inception v3, and a custom CNN designed from scratch, across three CLEF datasetsâ€”FungiCLEF, AnimalCLEF, and PlantCLEF. Each team member focused on one of the domains, using standardized data preprocessing, training pipelines, and evaluation metrics to ensure fair comparison. Our results show that while DenseNet and Inception networks generally outperform the custom model in terms of accuracy, the custom architecture shows promise with significantly reduced computational cost. The experiments also reveal dataset-specific challenges and highlight the importance of architecture selection in biodiversity-related FGVC tasks.
